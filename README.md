+ Project summary: It goes without saying that divorce and the stories behind it are becoming heated topics in the contemporary society. One can hardly go anywhere without hearing about the shockingly high divorce rates constantly broadcasted by the press and media. In this script, we focus on a couple of general factors that are associated with the end of marriages. Firstly, we took a look at the distinct divorce rates in different states. Then we examined separately the relationships between the divorce rates and the contributing factors of interests, including education levels, income levels, race, occupations, and working hours per week. Moreover, following the thread of curiosity, we took a closer look at  several specific topics, such as which race demonstrates a relatively higher divorce rate, whether people working in the financial industry are more prone to divorce,  or how the financial conditions and working time affect the qualities of marriages? Finally, we compared and analyzed two cities that illustrated the highest and lowest divorce rates based on our former results.
	
**Contribution statement**: ([default](doc/a_note_on_contributions.md)) All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement. At beginning, Weichuan Wu analyzed functions and packages that might be used. Jingjing Feng and Chenxi Huang investigated the features and selected variables of interests. Yiqun Nian cleaned and manipulated the data. During the progress, everyone contributed to R code. Weichuan was responsible for the 'income', 'working hour' and 'spideweb chart', and he is the person who concluded and summaried all the code. Jingjing was mainly responsible for the 'occupation&industry' part. Chenxi was mainly responsible for the 'education level' part. In a word,the code was modified several times with team discussion. By collaborating with each other, all team members contributed equally to whole project.
